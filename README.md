# Crypto-Scalpers-Search-Tool

# Ethereum Wallet Pattern Analysis Tool

This tool allows you to scrape transaction data from a specific Ethereum project's contract address using the Etherscan API. It can then identify accounts that buy and sell at the same time within a certain time frame.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Requests library (`pip install requests`)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ethereum-wallet-pattern-analysis.git
   cd ethereum-wallet-pattern-analysis

Obtain an Etherscan API key by registering on the Etherscan website.
Replace 'your_api_key_here' with your Etherscan API key in both sections of code (fetch_transactions function).
Replace '0x...' with the specific project's contract address.
Section 1: Fetching Transaction Data
The fetch_transactions function in fetch_transactions.py retrieves transaction data from the Etherscan API for a given contract address.

To run the script:
python fetch_transactions.py

Section 2: Identifying Buy-Sell Matches
The find_matching_transactions function in find_matching_transactions.py analyzes the fetched transactions to identify accounts that buy and sell at the same time.

To run the script:
python find_matching_transactions.py

Notes

This tool is a basic implementation and might require further customization based on your specific use case.
Respect Etherscan's API usage policies and rate limits.
